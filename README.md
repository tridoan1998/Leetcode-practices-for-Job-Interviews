Leetcode practices for Job Interviewssssssss

Notes:
For Tree: either iteratively or recursively. For iterratively, use BFS. For recursively, use DFS 
For String: use sliding window, left right pointers, two pointers. 
For array: Use Kadane althorithm, temp max and final max
For matrix: it's okay to use 2D array and O(N^2) time complexity
For linkedlist: use 2 pointers, fast and slow
